Odin Project Recipe Portion

This project will pull together allof the basic HTML tags and attributes learned up until now, to create a very basic recipe page.

Page will contain links to various recipes.

Later on, we will tidy it up using CSS.

THis will include anchors with hrefs, img tags, sorted and unsorted lists, various text tags (em, strong, mark, pre, blockquote, br, etc...)
 and will also utilise attributes within the varius  tags.
