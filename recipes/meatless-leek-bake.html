    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Albanian meatless leek bake is a dish using the combination of leeks and red peppers to bring through natural sweetness, 
        baked with rice creating a filling leek dish that's quick and easy to make.
    </p>
    <p>We grow a lot of leeks in our Albanian garden so I've found so many new ways to cook with them over the last couple of years. 
        Being a cheap and popular vegetable to buy as well as easy to grow they are found in a lot of winter recipes as they add a natural 
        sweetness to the dish. I find that most leek recipes are similar with just one or two ingredient differences such as meat or no meat, 
        red peppers or no red peppers and rice or no rice. You'll find that you can mix together any combination to make a completely different taste.
    </p>
    <p>February seems to be the best month for leeks however they start to come into season in August and can last through until April time in some 
        places. Leeks are part of the onion family but are much sweeter, you can often find them used to enrich soups and bakes.
